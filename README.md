# back_end_api_mongo


This is a small set up for a flask application connected to a Mongo Database via PyMongo. 
Some **routes** serve to allow the user to download data and or images from an api endpoint provided by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (see https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_sample_code.html). 

This functionality can be expanded on the future to create a custom **dashboard** containing for grabbing current visualization and data (in JSON format) for desired series.
